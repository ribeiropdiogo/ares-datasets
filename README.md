# Truth Discoverty Datasets

The datasets in this repository were created to assess truth discovery solutions using data which mimics personal records, since this type of information is not publicly available due to privacy concerns. Therefore, there are **two datasets** in this repository, each with **3 variants**: **3 sources**, **5 sources**, and **10 sources**.

The **name** dataset contains claims about the **name of an individual**. Each source provides a single claim about the name of an individual.

The **multi** datasets builds on the previous one, by adding 2 additional claims for each source. The **age** is added to assess the continuous data type. The **nationality** of the individual is included to assess categorical data. The main difference of the **multi** dataset resides in it comprising all three data types (String, Continuous, and Categorical), thus being useful in assessing the support of heterogeneous data.
